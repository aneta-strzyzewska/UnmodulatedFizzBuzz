# UnmodulatedFizzBuzz

Quick exercise to create a version of FizzBuzz without using modulo. 

Operates by maintaining a fizz and a buzz counter. 

- If fizz reaches 3, prints Fizz,
- if buzz reaches 5, prints Buzz,
- if fizz reaches 3 and buzz reaches 5 at the same time, prints FizzBuzz,
- otherwise, prints the current number.
